What was the challenge?
Creating a shop database, creating and adding data to the tables and then filtering the tables to specific results only.

How I expected the challenge to go.
i expect that it this is going to be a hard assignment as databases is new to me.

What went well?
we collaborated with other tdp members to solve the problems.

What didn't go as planned?
The tasks were even more tricky than expected.

Possible improvements for future challenges

work with other tdp members as a group to allow us to complete the assignment more simply.
